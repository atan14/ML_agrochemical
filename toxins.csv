1642362,103325,"Alpha-Bungarotoxin Binding Assay: Protocol 2: Studies were carried out using rat brain P2 membrane. All membrane was obtained from male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and collected on phosphate buffer. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent. In an ¿-Bungarotoxin binding assay, membrane was diluted with assay buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM pH 8.0 EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1% BSA). Test compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO solution. The starting concentration of the test compound was 3 ¿M, 8 points in 3 fold dilution. Assays were performed in a total volume of 200 ¿L containing [3H] ¿-Bungarotoxin (final concentration 0.4 nM), membrane suspension (80 ¿L containing 150 ¿g of membrane protein) and 20 ¿L of test compound. Non-specific binding (NSB) was determined with 1 ¿M ¿-Bungarotoxin. After 3 hours incubation (37° C.), the assay solution was transferred to a GF/B plate (Millipore). The assay was terminated by adding 100 ¿L ice-cold PBS dilution and then rapidly filtering over glass fiber filters presoaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine. The filters were washed 4 times with 200 ¿L/well of ice-cold PBS. They were then were transferred to the reading plate, and 250 ¿L of microscine 40 was added. The radioactivity trapped by the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting MicroBeta.",B,,,"Rattus norvegicus",,,,,,12167,H,8,Autocuration,37,,CHEMBL3889085,,BAO_0000019,,,8416_2_pol_5127
